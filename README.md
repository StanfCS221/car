# car
Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person. This specific repo is focused on Bayesian Networks, modelling car-tracking as a Bayesian Network and calculating the probability of cars position being (x,y).
Modeling car-tracking as a Hidden Markov Model.
Observing distance provided by a noisy sensor reading and then using that reading to calculate the probabilities of car being in a position (x,y).
Using cars current position to estimate the probabilities of car travelling to a new position in a given time in order to avoid crashes.
Finally, using the fact that cars cannot teleport and have a partially predictable direction of moving we can totally dismiss calculating the probabilities of very distant position and just assume the probability of car being there to be 0 (if at a time t sensor says car is in Belgrade than we don't have to worry about it being in Paris at a time t+1). This shortcut is implemented using Particle Filtering.
